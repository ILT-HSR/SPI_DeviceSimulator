# ![SPICE Logo](https://github.com/LukasMuellerILT/SPICE/tree/master/SPICE_Logos/SPICE_064.png) SPI_DeviceSimulator

SPI_DeviceSimulator is an implemented SiLA ServiceProvider based on [SPICE](https://github.com/LukasMuellerILT/SPICE).

## Idea
* Idea is to have a SiLA ServiceProvider available which implements as much as possible of the existing standard.
This enables to test available PMSs (Process Management Systems) and see how they react on diffrent situations and
how proper they work with the diffrent data-types.
* It also gives an idea how SPICE can be used.

## Provided Functionality
* A series of commands with parameter in diffrent data-types. The commands always return the parameter-value in their response-data.
* Two commands which are possible to run parallel to themself and each other.
* Two commands which aren't able to run parallel.
* A command which throws an error. The error-type can be set over the parameter (as example: recoverable / not recoverable)
* WSDiscovery (Type: "SiLADevice", no Scope)

## SiLAVersion
SPI_DeviceSimulator v1.0: based on SPICE 1.0.x, implements SiLA DCIS 1.3.08 specification
